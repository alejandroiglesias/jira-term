          <h2>jira-term</h2>

          <p>This is a fork of the <a href="http://tebriel.github.com/jira-cli/">jira-cli</a> project which isn't active at the moment, so I built on top of it.  Also, I forked and used the <a href="http://tebriel.github.com/jira-cli/">jira-cli</a> project because my current day job has very tightly controlled custom workflows where various fields can be required based on workflow actions, and I wanted to keep that separate.</p>

          <p>This is also a project for me to get back into CoffeeScript and to better understand using Travis, GitHub pages, self documenting code, and other tools.  Make no mistake, I use this in my daily work, but until version 0.3.0 or so is hit, this might be buggy in edge cases (e.g. custom fields required on create, and so on).</p>

          <h2>Why use this?</h2>

          <p>Managing an eight person dev team, plus having work of my own, I'm stuck in Jira about three hours a day.  That's answering status questions, attending scrums and pulling lists for people, prepping and tagging releases, and then I have my own queue in Jira for designs and prototype I owe for various projects.  Easily an hour of the three I spend is fidning what to click in the Jira UI and then fumbling around.  I wanted, and needed, a faster way to get my answers and data in something I'm fairly fast at: shell.
          </p>

          <p>
          Oh and I love Node.js and CoffeeScript, and since the Jira-cli project had about 80% fo what I needed, this all worked out well.
          </p>

          <h2>Great, so what does it do now?</h2>

          <ul>
          <li>Lists your issues by default</li>
          <li>List all projects you have access to</li>
          <li>Finds an issue by Key (AB-123) or Id (123456)</li>
          <li>Opens an issue </li>
          <li>Allows user to add a new ticket to various projects</li>
          <li>Transitions an issue (shows all available transition states)</li>
          <li>Adds a worklog to an issue</li>
          <li>Allow searching to be limited by project id or name</li>
          <li>Returns results in a simple or detailed output</li>
          <li>Colors things you care about which is (somewhat) customizable</li>
          </ul>
